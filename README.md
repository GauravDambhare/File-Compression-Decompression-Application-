# File-Compression-Decompression-Application-
Build a command-line utility that performs a  task, such as file compression / decompression .
## Project Description: Java Command-Line Tool

Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a Java command-line utility that performs a specific task, such as file compression or decompression . The utility will be designed to run in a terminal or command prompt environment and will provide users with the ability to perform the desired task efficiently and effectively.

## Requirements:

### Programming Language: 
Use Java as the primary programming language for developing the command-line utility.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI): 
Create a user-friendly CLI that allows users to interact with the utility. Users should be able to execute commands, provide input, and receive output through the terminal or command prompt.


### Command Syntax: 
Define a clear and intuitive command syntax for executing the chosen task. Consider using flags, options, or parameters to customize the behavior of the utility and provide flexibility to the user.

### Input Handling: 
Design the utility to handle various types of input, such as files, directories, or user-provided text. Implement error handling and validation to ensure that the utility can handle different scenarios gracefully.

### Output Generation: 
Generate the desired output based on the chosen task. This could involve creating compressed files, modifying text files, generating reports, or displaying results in the terminal or command prompt.

### Documentation: 
Provide comprehensive documentation for the command-line utility. Include instructions on how to install, configure, and use the utility. Document the command syntax, available options, and examples of common use cases.

### Error Handling: 
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the utility. Provide informative error messages to help users understand and resolve issues.

### Testing: 
Perform thorough testing of the command-line utility to ensure its correctness and reliability. Write unit tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases. Consider using frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG for automated testing.

### Version Control: 
Utilize a version control system (such as Git) to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and maintain a history of the project.

### User-Friendly Interface: 
Strive to create a user-friendly interface that provides clear instructions, informative messages, and intuitive interaction. Consider implementing features such as progress indicators, help commands, or interactive prompts.

### Future Extensibility: 
Design the command-line utility in a modular and extensible manner, allowing for easy addition of new features or functionality in the future.

### Conclusion:
Building a Java command-line utility involves several key components, including a user-friendly CLI, task implementation, input/output handling, error handling, documentation, testing, packaging, and more. By carefully considering these requirements and following best practices, you can create a robust and useful tool that fulfills the specified task efficiently and effectively.
